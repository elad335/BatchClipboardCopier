This tool tracks whenever the clipboard state changes and adds it to the internal buffer of clipboard selections.
It also saves the last clipboard results, because there is no telling if an additional copy of it was made after the button press.
Tracking begins using the "Begin Clipboard Listening" button and ends with a button press on "Stop And Output Results".
The results are then outputted to the textbox below and the COUT channel.
This is very useful, at least when using Windows, to copy many selections and paste them at once.
